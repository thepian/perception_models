# Perception Models: Powerful Models for Image and Video Perception

**[Meta AI Research, FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research)**

Perception Models is home to the state-of-the-art for image and video _perception_: Perception Encoder (PE) for encoding and Perception Language Model (PLM) for decoding. We designed Perception Models as a user-friendly repository to support the training, inference, and evaluation of these two models, with an emphasis on making the code modular and easy to expand and experiment with.


* **[Apr-18-25]:** Perception Language Model (PLM) and PLM-VideoBench are added to lmms-eval. This makes it easy to reproduce PLM results and allows you to evaluate on the PLM-VideoBench. [[`lmms-eval`](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval/pull/638)] :fire::fire:
* **[Apr-17-25]:** Perception Encoder (PE) and Perception Language Model (PLM) are released. [[`Blog`](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-fair-updates-perception-localization-reasoning)] :fire::fire:


## Perception Encoder (PE)

Perception Encoder (PE) is an extremely powerful and versatile family of vision encoders for both images and video: PE core can outperform SigLIP2 on Image CLIP and InternVideo2 on Video CLIP; PE lang can be used to outperform QwenVL2.5 and InternVL3 on vision language modeling; and PE spatial can outperform DINOv2 on dense prediction tasks. And all of this follows the same, easily scalable contrastive pretraining.

See [`apps/pe/README.md`](apps/pe/README.md) for more information and how to get started using them!

PerceptionLM (PLM) is a family of open and fully reproducible models to facilitate research in vision-language modeling (VLM). In conjunction with PE, it is powerful enough to compete with the latest state-of-the-art VLMs such as InternVL3 and QwenVL2.5, while using _fully open data_. We also release the largest spatiotemporally annotated video dense captioning and fine-grained human activity recognition datasets to ever exist.

See [`apps/plm/README.md`](apps/plm/README.md) for details and how to get started!


## Installation :wrench:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models.git
cd perception_models

conda create --name perception_models python=3.12
conda activate perception_models

# Install PyTorch
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# We use torchcodec for decoding videos into PyTorch tensors
conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
pip install torchcodec==0.1 --index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

pip install -e .
```
This will install an editable version of repo, allowing you to make changes to the code without needing to reinstall the package every time.
